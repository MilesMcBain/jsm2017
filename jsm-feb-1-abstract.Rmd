### Data structures and functions for consistent exploration of missing data


Missing values are ubiquitous in data and need to be explored and handled in the initial stages of analysis. Superficial treatment of missing values can lead to biased results. However, the exploration of missing values can be a difficult process.  There is a need for a framework that supports the exploratory data analysis of missing data. This paper describes a package, `naniar`, for exploring missing data dependencies with minimal deviation from the common workflows of ggplot and tidy data [@wickham2014]. Typically, ggplot2 throws an warning about missings but then omits them for plotting [@wickham2009ggplot2]. The principles of tidy data state that each row is an observation and each column is a variable, which makes it easy and consistent to perform data manipulation and wrangling, but there are no guidelines for representing additional missing data structures in a tidy format. Our extension builds data structures and functions that ensure missings are handled effectively for plotting, summarising, and examining imputations.
